                        reach of every hand. Anyone may gather it and no limit is set."

        <p>

            “Love is dynamic not static” which means it changes or drift between
            different types of love and overtime love will teach you to create the love
            that you’ve been looking for. In the tale of Enchanted before princess Giselle was
            banished from the animated world she thought her true love was prince Edward when he
            rescued her from a trap and even plans to get married but after she was banished to the real
            world she eventually fell in love with Robert the lawyer who was going to propose to her longtime
            girlfriend and everything changed.
        </p>
   

        <h3 style="padding-bottom: .5em;padding-top: .5em;font-weight: bold;"> Compassion and Affection </h3>
        <p>
            These are two similar terms with a slight difference in between where compassion is when you see
            someone suffering and you’re deeply concerned about them and wishes to relieve it while Affection is the
            physical act that you do to help them. In the story when Giselle was banished to the real world she was lost
            and running around in a modern city where she had no clue and this is where she’s been rescued by Robert and
            his
            daughter Morgan while they were on their way home and then trusts Giselle and offers her to stay at their
            apartment,
            both showing her “Compassion and Affection”

        </p>

        <h3 style="padding-bottom: .5em;padding-top: .5em;font-weight: bold;"> Respect and Kindness </h3>
        <p>
            Kindness without respect is degrading. Respect is the base line of Human Interaction. requires that we
            acknowledge
            the existence and autonomy of others. Kindness is bestowed upon others without them having to earn it.
            “Robert realizes
            that true love's kiss is the only force powerful enough to break the apple's spell. Edward's kiss fails to
            wake Giselle, and
            Edward and Nancy (Robert’s Girlfriend) prompt Robert to do so instead.” This is a part of the tale where it
            clearly reveals
            respect and kindness to each other and chosen love over hate.
